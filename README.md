# Hello, Mechanical Turk!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Mechanical Turk!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-mechanical-turk) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Mechanical Turk and crowd-sourcing human intelligence tasks. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Mechanical Turk and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to crowd-source human intelligence tasks. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Mechanical Turk Project

We will write a .NET program that can create HITs and get results using the AWS SDK for .NET. The HIT we'll create will ask workers what is their favorite flavor of ice cream. We'll run this in the MTurk developer sandbox to avoid any charges.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
